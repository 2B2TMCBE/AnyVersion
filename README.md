# AnyVersion

This plugin is created to make possible to connect to nukkit server after releasing new Minecrat Pocket Edition.

For example currently Nukkit supports 0.13.1 client, but my Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition already updated to 0.13.2.


Using this plugin I can connect to server without modifying the Nukkit code.


Warning! This plugin is provided for testing purposes only and if you going to use this plugin you must understood that it's just a "hack", that provided without any warranties.


I don't recommending to install this plugin on "real server".

P.S. There's no permission, configuration and commands. Just install and enjoy :)
